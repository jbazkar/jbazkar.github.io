## Baskaran Jeyarajan
**IEEE Senior Member | Raptor Fellowship Member | AI-Driven Cloud Reliability Architect | Innovator in Predictive Enterprise Automation**

I am a technology leader with two decades of multi-domain experience advancing the fields of AI-powered DevOps, cloud platform engineering, and enterprise SRE. My work focuses on integrating machine learning, modern cloud architectures, and operational intelligence to build platforms that are adaptive, self-correcting, and engineered for large-scale reliability.

I design impactful solutions such as SmartOps, an AI-driven predictive monitoring framework for BFSI systems, and SmartFactCheckBot, a public misinformation-detection platform using NLP model distillation. I also contribute to globally recognized open-source projects including AWS CDK, Lambda Powertools, Karpenter, and MCP.

As an IEEE Senior Member, international researcher with 9 IEEE-indexed publications, and reviewer/session chair for major engineering conferences, I continue to advance innovation across AI, cloud computing, DevOps automation, and public-benefit technology.
