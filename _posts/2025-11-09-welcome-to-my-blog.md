This is my first post. I’ll share quick notes, fixes, and deep dives on **AWS**, **platform engineering**, **SRE**, and **AI for DevOps**.

- Expect hands-on snippets (Terraform, ECS/Fargate, GitHub Actions)
- Release engineering playbooks and incident writeups
- AIOps experiments (anomaly detection, predictive scaling)

Stay tuned!
