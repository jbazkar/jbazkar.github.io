Artificial Intelligence is transforming how enterprises operate their release pipelines.  
**SmartOps** is my in-house conceptual framework that integrates AI models into DevOps workflows — enabling predictive monitoring, anomaly detection, and self-healing automation.

### 🔍 Core Concept
SmartOps combines:
- **Predictive Analytics**: to detect potential release failures early.  
- **Anomaly Detection Models**: to flag latency or service degradation in pre-prod and prod.  
- **Automated Remediation**: via scripted rollbacks and scaling decisions.

### ⚙️ Architecture Overview
[Commit] → [CI Pipeline] → [Model Scoring] → [Decision Engine] → [Deploy / Hold / Rollback]

### 🧩 Real-World Use
In one of our enterprise platforms, SmartOps reduced post-release incidents by **32%** and shortened mean time-to-recover by **45%**.

### 🚀 Future Enhancements
I’m working on extending SmartOps to integrate with **CloudWatch Anomaly Detection**, **Prometheus metrics**, and **LLM-based release advisories**.
